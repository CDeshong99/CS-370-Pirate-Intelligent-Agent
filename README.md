# Project Work Summary
For this project, I was given a partially completed Jupyter Notebook with a predefined environment and helper files such as TreasureMaze.py and GameExperience.py, which defined the environment structure and logging functionality. I created the core logic for the deep Q-learning agent myself. This included building the neural network model, implementing the experience replay mechanism, and training the agent through interaction with the environment to learn an optimal path to the treasure. I also adjusted hyperparameters to achieve a 100% win rate and ensured that the training loop was robust and reproducible. All new code was developed using Python and TensorFlow, with in-line comments provided for clarity and maintainability.
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve real-world problems using computational thinking, algorithms, and programming. Their work powers the systems we rely on dailyâ€”from healthcare and education to transportation and entertainment. This project reflects how computer science can simulate intelligent behavior, which is crucial for fields like robotics, game development, and autonomous systems.
# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I start by understanding the problem space, breaking the problem down into smaller manageable parts, and designing an algorithmic solution. In this project, I analyzed how reinforcement learning could be used to teach an agent to navigate a maze, then iteratively tested and refined my approach by tuning hyperparameters and evaluating results.
# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, I am responsible for ensuring that the systems I build are secure, fair, and transparent. This includes avoiding bias in decision-making algorithms, protecting user data, and making AI systems interpretable and accountable. For this project, I considered how agents make decisions and the implications if such systems were deployed in real-world scenarios without oversight.
